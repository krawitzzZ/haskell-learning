# Haskell-learning

This is a repository where I track all my Haskell exercises.

## Prerequisite

If you don't have a recent Stack version installed in your system, follow the
[installation instructions](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)
for your operating system.

## Building and Running

Run `stack build` initially, then to execute the program run `stack run`.

## Testing

To execute the tests run `stack test`.
